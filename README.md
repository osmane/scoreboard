[scoreboard](https://scoreboard-osmane.vercel.app/leaderboard.html) and [lobby](https://scoreboard-osmane.vercel.app/lobby) for [osmane/billiards](https://github.com/osmane/billiards) running on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/osmanes-projects/scoreboard) with [nchan](https://billiards-network.onrender.com/) running on render.com.

This project is a work in progress experiment to get AI LLMs to code a complex task. About half the code is generated by combinations of github copilot, gpt4o, claude, cline, deepseek, gemini-flash-thinking and even [webarena](https://web.lmarena.ai/).

I have to intervene and untangle things now and then but these tools allowed me to get away with minimal understanding of react and nextjs. I am blown away with it all - could never have imagined this a couple of years ago. It is a thrill to witness these advances (being put use to nonsense).
